SYNOPSIS

A Rails app that allows users to enter Southwest flight tickets and automatically checks them in on Southwest before the flight.

MOTIVATION

Unlike most other airlines, Southwest Airlines does not give ticketed passengers assigned seats on flights. Instead, they give passengers a "boarding position" (A1-A30, B1-B30, C1-C30) depending on when they check in to the flight. Passengers who board earlier have access to more window/aisle seats, rows closer to the front of the plane, and more overhead bin space. The check-in window for Southwest flight opens 24 hours before departure. The purpose of this app is to check users in on their flights right after the window opens.

Note: Southwest's "A-list" program gives frequent flyers preferential treatment when it comes to their check-in boarding position. A-listers have access to reserved boarding positions (usually A1-A30) as well as a check-in window that opens 36 hours before departure.
